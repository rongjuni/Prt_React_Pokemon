        <Card.Text>
          Everytime my 3 years old daughter throws a tantrum, I show her this
          list of pokemons and ask her whom she wants to talk to. Then I pretent
          to call and talk to the pokemon and tell her that they will visit our
          home if she is doing well. It has costed little extra money as I had
          to buy pokemon plushies who promised to visit, but it works greatly to
          calm her down. üòÅ
